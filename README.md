Pepper pairs people for meals at diners, so no one has to eat alone if they don't want to.

How it works: 
1. Choose your diner on the home screen
2. Wait till you are paired with a friend (you can close the app)
3. When a match is found, you will be sent a location in the diner to go to, as well as an emoji. Your match will also be at the same location with the same emoji, so make sure your phone is visible so you can find each other
4. Once you find your match, then grab a table! Feel free to go through the conversation starters on the app or talk about whatever's on your mind. 
5. When you're done, click "End Meal"
